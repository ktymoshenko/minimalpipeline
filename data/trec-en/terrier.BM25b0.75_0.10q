1403 NYT20000416.0233-3 39 12.584797742329517 false Most of the buzz about fuel cells involves the automobile, because Detroit, with help from Washington, is spending billions to see whether the devices will someday provide an alternative to the internal-combustion engine.
1403 NYT19980621.0062-5 40 12.538469624882898 false Virtually none of the bicycle or scooter owners in Italy wears a crash helmet, yet they seem completely unconcerned, despite the fact that nobody in the country _ dating back to the invention of the combustion engine _ has ever been detected yielding the right of way or swerving to avoid any object other than the occasional dead burro.
1403 NYT19980723.0120-12 41 12.498002724227703 false Even though the compression ratios are the same, the heat generated in the combustion chamber of the boosted engine is higher.

1403 XIE20000922.0087-2 43 12.311829184113636 false Shi started his research career in the field of internal- combustion engine after he graduated from Manchester University's graduate institute in 1949. He was China's first doctorate scholar in the field.
1403 NYT19981117.0448-10 44 12.311829184113636 false In one of his few references to the environment, Gore called for private-sector ideas that would ``stop global warming without economic cooling.'' He did not, absolutely not, revive his 1992 suggestion that the internal combustion engine should be eliminated.
1403 NYT19991219.0127-12 45 12.311829184113636 false For now, however, the internal combustion engine will continue to rule. And while it is possible that an oil shortage may develop this winter, experts said that oil would remain plentiful over the longer term.
1403 NYT19990428.0058-28 46 12.202662766866206 true The first internal-combustion engine was built in 1867, but no motor vehicles came along for decades, because the public was content with horses and railroads. Transistors were invented in the United States, but the country's electronics industry ignored them to protect its investment in vacuum-tube products; it was left to Sony in bombed-out postwar Japan to adapt transistors to consumer-electronics products.
1403 APW20000407.0004-13 47 12.061470319504181 false Gramm's language stated opposition to a $3 per gallon gasoline tax increase -- which Gramm said would be a way to eliminate internal combustion engines. Gore proposed moving away from the engines in his book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' but proposed no such tax boost.
1403 NYT20000707.0056-18 48 12.050450793588281 false How Gore, the author of ``Earth in the Balance'' and a keen proponent of ridding the world of the internal-combustion engine, can piously insist that he also believes in low energy prices beggars belief.
1403 NYT20000615.0266-13 49 12.050450793588281 false In a telephone interview, he said: ``There are three attributes you're trading off _ emissions, fuel economy and acceleration, or performance. You decide what it is you want your vehicle to do in those three attributes, and then you size your internal-combustion engine and your motor so as to get the combination you're interested in.''
