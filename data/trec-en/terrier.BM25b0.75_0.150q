Hammer of the University of Arizona, an expert who studies the genetics of human populations through the male or Y chromosome. Unlike the other chromosomes, the genetic material on the Y chromosome is not shuffled every generation, obscuring the lines of individual descent. Y chromosomes are bequeathed from father to son, more or less unchanged apart from the occasional mutation.

1404 NYT20000403.0358-15 25 11.505468088432655 true But assigning the markers used in the mapping to specific canine chromosomes, an essential process to exploiting the data's full potential, has proceeded more slowly. Although the canine genome, like that of humans, is estimated to have three billion base pairs of DNA and 100,000 genes, they are distributed over 78 chromosomes, compared with 46 in humans. To date, only about two-thirds of the dog chromosomes have been identified, many of them by the Animal Trust Fund in England, and fewer than half of the existing markers have been assigned to chromosomes.
1404 NYT19990108.0170-13 26 11.489796129438783 true Maddox also envisions a time when far more will be known about human evolution. The genomes of apes and humans differ by only a few percent, but in an unusual way. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, while great apes have 24. And part of the ``missing'' ape chromosome turns up on one arm of human chromosome 2. How could natural selection have produced such a radical cut-and-paste job? Answering such questions will require ``every scrap of information from paleontology and ecology. . . . But that is how the history of the human race will be reconstructed in the next century or so.''

In 1954, the Briton became the first to run a mile in less than 4 minutes, doing so in 3 minutes 59.4 seconds. Now international track meets generally bypass the mile in favor of the slightly shorter 1,500 meters. Still, the mile retains glamour, so there was excitement when Hicham el-Guerrouj, a 24-year-old Moroccan, lowered the world record to 3 minutes 43.13 seconds in Rome.

Maurice Dean Wint, as a gruff cop, takes the Gene Hackman role as ruthless leader; Nicole de Boer, as a whiny math whiz, takes on the Carole Lynley role as an annoying negativist. The only actor here who doesn't have a Poseidon counterpart is Andrew Miller, who gives such an irritating performance as an autistic savant, you can't really identify with the innocence his character is supposed to represent. You want him to stay trapped.

She said six people were taken to hospitals in Roanoke and  Charlottesville. Their conditions were not immediately available.
1436 APW19980723.0932-3 32 10.310860620809851 false A return by Jackson seems to be a long shot at best. At the beginning of last season, Jackson had said: ``It would take wild horses to drag me back'' for another season.
1436 NYT20000615.0039-12 33 10.1064920796557 false And that's a hard thing to do when Jackson is shouting, ``What's my name?!''

But Dr. Michael Ort, a geologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, said he had evidence that this body of water, called Hopi Lake, was ephemeral. It would fill up occasionally and then dry out for long periods, Ort said. It does not appear that an ancient Colorado River could have drained into Hopi Lake, he said.
1438 XIE20000325.0022-5 37 13.460563676072063 false Syria and Iraq, the downstream countries of the two rivers, accuse the upstream Turkey of reducing flow of water to them. Demirel argued ,"How much of water from the rivers will be used by Turkey and the other countries respectively?"

The beauty of this theory is that it ties together a lot of conflicting ideas concerning evidence for an old river east of the Kaibab Upwarp and a young one west of it.''
1438 XIE19980808.0102-3 48 13.23112341350171 false An hour later, the crest joined water from the Qingjiang River and headed downstream at an even bigger rate of flow, raising the water level of the river below Yichang to above the danger mark.

After 2002, VW will just produce Bentleys. Other models in the Bentley lineup, the Azure convertible and Continental R and Continental T, remain unchanged.

The fate of the baby in the basket shows God's hand at work through the women involved in the incident and the helplessness of pharoah to counteract the will of God. The burning bush illustrates how God's interventions disrupt the status quo. The parting of the Red Sea shows that God can use the forces of land and sea to bring about necessary political liberation.

Waves of small wavelength have more chances to ``hit'' a particle, while those of longer wavelength tend to just skirt around. You can get a rough idea of what's happening if you think of water waves hitting a boat: Small-wavelength waves bounce off, while long-wavelength waves tend to bend around the boat.

Currently, when a fiber optic cable carrying dozens of different wavelengths of light reaches an electronic switch, each wavelength must take a different path through the switch. As optical cables evolve to handle more and more wavelengths, which is crucial in expanding capacity, electronic switches must be reconfigured or replaced. But the newest MEMS switches, once installed, can redirect 10 wavelengths or hundreds without needing to be changed or expanded.

In practice, since many signals at different wavelengths are traveling simultaneously down each fiber, the MEMS package requires a device that separates the arriving wavelengths and directs each to a different mirror so that it can be switched to its specific destination. The system also requires a similar device to intercept and rebundle the switched signals so that each outgoing fiber also carries as many different wavelengths as possible.

Crockett had definitely died at the heroic battle of the Alamo, though there were conflicting accounts of the manner in which he'd met his end.

Amid the juggernaut of myth and merchandising that Disney unleashed in Davy's name in the mid-1950s, the reality of Crockett was transfigured beyond recognition.

1537 NYT20000105.0062-29 3 14.695170658150953 true A: Not necessarily. Men who have lost the popular vote have served as president because they won a majority of the votes in the Electoral College. When you cast a vote for president, you are technically voting for a set of presidential electors. If your candidate wins the popular vote in your state, the electors you have voted for then cast their votes in the Electoral College. There are 538 electoral votes, meaning it takes 270 to win. Each state has electoral votes equal to its representation in the Congress. Georgia, for example, has 13 votes (11 House members plus two senators). The District of Columbia also has three votes.

1537 NYT20000927.0090-18 8 13.379958480758024 true Cook said the race is extraordinarily tight. In his widely watched electoral college analysis, Cook reported that Gore is ahead in states with 231 electoral votes, while Bush is ahead in states with 179, with another 128 electoral votes in 11 tossup states. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to become president.
1537 NYT20000826.0081-7 9 13.22769103084665 false Another reason to hold off on the alarm is the Electoral College. The Republicans' strength in the South and near West gives Bush a firm foundation of electoral votes. Whatever the polls say about the popular vote, most strategists agree that Gore's chances of breaking open a wide Electoral College lead, especially this soon, are not realistic. The campaigns are battling fiercely in important regions, particularly the Midwest, for the 270 electoral votes needed to win.

1537 NYT20000911.0123-27 15 12.983639901363798 false Bush is ahead in three polls, Gore in three others. Based on the most recent state polls, Bush has 223 Electoral College votes to Gore's 228, which means neither has the 270 needed to win. Since America chooses its president through the Electoral College, not by direct popular vote, this is the relevant measure.
1537 NYT20000313.0354-14 16 12.778812787752273 false California, with 54 electoral votes, is the big prize. Electoral College math says Gore cannot win without carrying California. Bush can, though the task becomes more difficult.
